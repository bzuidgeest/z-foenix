This is an experimental hobby project for me to relearn some C programming by trying to make an Z-machine interpreter that can run on
the c256 foenix. For now I'm still testing and feeling things out and just using gcc. At some point this will switch to a c-compiler for
the 65816 cpu.

At this moment all code here should be considered not functional.
